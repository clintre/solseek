# Solseek
## A TUI Package Manager for Solus

[Features](#features) | [Requirements & Installation](#requirements)

Solseek is a simple terminal user interface which allows you to browse, search, and manage packages from the Solus packages. Packages can be installed, reinstalled, updated, verified, and removed through the interface. It is built around the native tools; bash, eopkg, flatpak, etc. to avoid complications. It uses the power of fzf for the ui/ux and filtering.

⚠️ Note: This is a work in progress!
