## AI Usage Policy

This project prioritizes human authorship and deep technical understanding. To maintain code quality and security, the following rules apply to all contributors:


### 1\. Prohibited: Substantial Code Contributions

- The use of AI to generate core logic, entire features, or complex architectural components is strictly prohibited.
- Contributors must be the primary authors of their logic.
- If a Pull Request (PR) appears to be primarily AI-generated without human oversight or original thought, it will be rejected.


### 2\. Permitted: Translation & Localization

- AI tools are permitted for assisting with localization and translation.
- You may use AI to translate documentation and text into other languages.
- This is limited to the language files only. 

Note: While permitted, please double-check for context accuracy to avoid "lost in translation" errors.  

### 3\. Restricted: Assistance & Code Completion

- The use of AI-powered assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc) for boilerplate and code completion is allowed, provided it follows these conditions:
- Human Verification: You are 100% responsible for the code. You must understand every line the AI suggests.
- Mandatory Disclosure: If AI assisted in writing the code (even just for completion), you must note this in your Pull Request description.


### 4\. How to Disclose

When submitting a Pull Request, please include a brief statement at the bottom of your description:  

"🤖 AI Disclosure: AI was used for \[code completion / translation / boilerplate generation\]."
