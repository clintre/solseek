Welcome to the Solseek Package Manager

This system is designed to work around the Solus package manager
eopkg. It expands on the base functions to include helpers for
updating other systems that you may have installed, such as Flatpak,
Snap, Distrobox, and Firmware updates.

The core features as of this version are...
    - Listing packages (search and manage packages)
    - Managing packages (install,update,check,remove)
    - System Updates (eopkg,flatpak,snap,distrobox,firmware)
    - Config and Information view and export
    - eopkg wrapper (ex. sudo solseek up = sudo eopkg up)

Potential future features...
    - Flatpak capabilities (list,search,install,etc.)
    - Update check and notify
    - Additional meta information for packages

To do...
    - Get some help with translation!
    - Maybe port to a more robust language
    - Clean up and normalize

Support...
Support is best effort at this time.
